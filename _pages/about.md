Hi, I am 孙豪 (Hao Sun), a second-year master's student from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. I am affiliated in [CoAI group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and fortunately supervised by A/Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml). Before I come to Tsinghua University, I got my bachelor's degree in Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

My research interests include NLP,  dialogue system, and dialogue safety. I am also familiar with some model pre-training  researches.

**I am looking for jobs** after I got my master's degree (June, 2023 in expect). I am very interested in jobs about 

1. Algorithm engineer about NLP (e.g. search engine, dialogue system)
2. NLP researcher

If you are hiring for one of these positions, and interested in me, I'd appreciate it if you could contact me by e-mail.
